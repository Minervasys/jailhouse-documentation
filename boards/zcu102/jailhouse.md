# Jailhouse on the ZCU102

The Jailhouse repository has already a
[guide](https://github.com/Minervasys/jailhouse/blob/minerva/next/Documentation/setup-on-zynqmp-zcu102.md)
(a bit outdated, but can be easily followed also with newer PetaLinux
(e.g. 2023.2)) which explain how to enable Jailhouse on the ZCU102.

> **NOTE**: just be sure to apply Linux
[patches](/jailhouse-enabling-patches/6.1.y/) for compiling and enabling Jailhouse.

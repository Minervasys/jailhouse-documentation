# Jailhouse on the ZCU102

The Jailhouse repository has already a guide (a bit outdated, but can be easily
followed also with newer PetaLinux (e.g. 2023.2)) which explain how to enable
Jailhouse on the ZCU102.

> **NOTE**: just be sure to apply Linux
[patches](jailhouse-enabling-patches/6.1.y/) for compiling and enabling Jailhouse.
